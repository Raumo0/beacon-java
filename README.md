##What it is
This project contains the BDK (beacon development kit) for Java (EE) developers. The BDK provides all of the tools required to create a basic rest implementation for a beacon almost straight out of the box with only minimal set up required.
Users can extend the BDK to make it fit within their own project, or use it as is defining their own adapter to retrieve data from their preferred data source.

##System requirements
All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later, Maven 3.0 or later. Since the project is Java EE based, an application server with support for Java EE 7 is needed to deploy the application (e.g. JBoss EAP or WildFly).

##Modules
1. [beacon-java-core](/beacon-java-core)
    Contains core classes and functions shared across modules in the BJDK.
2. [beacon-java-rest](/beacon-java-rest)
    Rest implementation of a beacon, configured to run on a JBOSS server.
3. [sample-beacon-adapter](/sample-beacon-adapter)
    Sample beacon adapter implementation

## Beacon Specification
The BDK implements the beacon specification and relies on the data models generated by the beacon schema. At the moment the dependency is not currently listed on maven central but can be retrived from the [beacon teams git hub repository](https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team). 

To retrieve the dependency:

```
git clone https://github.com/ga4gh/beacon-team
cd beacon-team
mvn clean install
```

## How it Works
The project provides the following:

- API for beacons
- sample beacon implementation
- conversion of parameters to a normalized form (the same way Beacon of Beacons does)
- sample navigation webpage
- sample testsuite
